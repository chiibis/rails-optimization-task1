* recursively called methods

Columns are:

  %self     - The percentage of time spent in this method, derived from self_time/total_time.
  total     - The time spent in this method and its children.
  self      - The time spent in this method.
  wait      - The amount of time this method waited for other threads.
  child     - The time spent in this method's children.
  calls     - The number of times this method was called.
  name      - The name of the method.
  location  - The location of the method.

The interpretation of method names is:

  * MyObject#test - An instance method "test" of the class "MyObject"
  * <Object:MyObject>#test - The <> characters indicate a method on a singleton class.
